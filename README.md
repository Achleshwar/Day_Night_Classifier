# Day_Night_Classifier

This repository explains a day and night classification model using shallow neural network built from scratch.

Shallow neural network involves a single hidden layer and can be used for classification models where you don't need
to need focus on the details of the image such as color classification. 

To understand the concepts in detail, refer to CS230 by Prof. Andrew NG.
